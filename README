To run the program, from the current folder where the scripts are present, the following commands are to be issued in the terminal.

Apart from standard python libraries, this project needs PyWavelets library (pywt) to run. 
Please install it before running project. 

To install PyWavelets open shell prompt and type pip install PyWavelets or easy_install PyWavelets.

Alternately, to build and install PyWavelets from source, unzip the compressed source file present in sources directory, navigate to PyWavelets source code directory and type python setup.py install.
In order to build PyWavelets from source, a working C compiler (GCC or MSVC) and a recent version of Cython is required.
More information on PyWavelets installation can be found at http://www.pybytes.com/pywavelets/index.html

To run the index.py file which creates the index files hsv.csv, texture.csv and btree.csv
> python  index.py -c hsv.csv -t texture.csv -b btree.csv -d <full path of dataset>

To run the rank.py file which ranks images in the given dataset with respect to the query image
(rank.py file also copies the high ranking 15 images to the result directory)
> py rank.py -c hsv.csv -t texture.csv -b btree.csv -q <full path of query image> -d <full path of dataset>

Dataset and query images used for testing the program are available in data folder.

result folder needs to be present in the current directory (eg. code) for the program to write output files to result directory.
